This folder contains the results of our image evaluation techniques: CLIP and HITL.
The CLIP folder has the prompt files for each batch with the CLIP score appended to the ends of their filenames
The HITL folder has csvs of both foodnames and ingredients labeled for accuracy (2=accurate, 1=somewhat accurate, 0=completely off).
